# PDL: TCPWM simultaneous startup by software trigger

This code example demonstrates how to trigger multiple TCPWM channels simultaneously by the software. In this case, the User LED2 and User LED3 on the target board connected to the PWM output pin and blink at the rate of 2 Hz with different duty cycles. These PWMs are made by TCPWM (Timer, Counter, and PWM) and simultaneously activated by the software via Trigger Multiplexer.

## Using the code example


### Create the project

The ModusToolbox&trade; tools package provides the Project Creator as both a GUI tool and a command line tool.

<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator GUI</b></summary>

1. Open the Project Creator GUI tool.

   There are several ways to do this, including launching it from the dashboard or from inside the Eclipse IDE. For more details, see the [Project Creator user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxProjectCreator) (locally available at *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/docs/project-creator.pdf*).

2. On the **Choose Board Support Package (BSP)** page, select a kit supported by this code example. See [Supported kits](#supported-kits-make-variable-target).

   > **Note:** To use this code example for a kit not listed here, you may need to update the source files. If the kit does not have the required resources, the application may not work.

3. On the **Select Application** page:

   a. Select the **Applications(s) Root Path** and the **Target IDE**.

   > **Note:** Depending on how you open the Project Creator tool, these fields may be pre-selected for you.

   b. Select this code example from the list by enabling its check box.

   > **Note:** You can narrow the list of displayed examples by typing in the filter box.

   c. (Optional) Change the suggested **New Application Name** and **New BSP Name**.

   d. Click **Create** to complete the application creation process.

</details>


<details><summary><b>Use Project Creator CLI</b></summary>

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.


The following example clones the "[mtb-example-ce240925-tcpwm-simultaneous-startup](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-ce240925-tcpwm-simultaneous-startup)" application with the desired name "TcpwmSimultaneousStartup" configured for the *KIT_T2G_C-2D-6M_LITE* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_T2G_C-2D-6M_LITE --app-id mtb-example-ce240925-tcpwm-simultaneous-startup --user-app-name TcpwmSimultaneousStartup --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```


The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
    </details>

4. After programming, the CE starts automatically. Confirm that the messages are displayed on the UART terminal, and confirm that the user LED2 and LED3 are blinking.

**Figure 1. Terminal output on program startup**

   <img src="./images/serial-terminal-output.png" width="640" /><BR>

5. The waveform that can be observed by the probe will be as follows, and the rising edges of both channels should be at the same timing:

## Design and implementation

**TCPWM waveform**

The PWM waves are configured to produce a 2 Hz PWM output. In this example, the output duty cycle is set to 70% for PWM_LEDA and 30% for PWM_LEDB, which generates a square wave. The output of the PWM_LEDA (connected to User LED2) and PWM_LEDB (connected to User LED3) blink at 500 ms (inverse of the PWM output frequency, 2 Hz). The configuration is done in a custom *design.modus* file. This can be opened and modified in **Device Configurator**. Once saved, all settings will be reflected to the codes.<BR>

**Figure 3. Counter setting**

<img src="./images/device_configurator_tcpwm.png"/><BR>
To vary the frequency and duty cycle of the PWM outputs, change the parameters on **Device Configurator** then rebuild and program the application. Observe the change in LED blink pattern.

- **Initialize and enable the TCPWM**
    1. Configure the *.startInput* and *.startInputMode* to get triggered by group trigger of Trigger Multiplexer.
    2. Set the configuration of each channel output as *PWM_LEDA_config* and *PWM_LEDB_config*, respectively.
    3. Initialize TCPWM is done in the <a href="https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__pwm.html#ga6440d2a9dc8d85056abd62556bee7f82"><i>Cy_TCPWM_PWM_Init()</i></a> function.
    4. Enable the TCPWM in the <a href="https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__pwm.html#ga802ebf3a49b1056e4bc5b057deb26e49"><i>Cy_TCPWM_PWM_Enable()</i></a> function. 
   > **Note:** The TCPWM operation clock starts at this point; if the TCPWM clock is set to divide the source clock, each channel starts operating at this timing, so even if simultaneous startup is performed by Trigger Multiplexer, the output PWM waveforms may not start at the same time.

- **Start the PWM**
    1. Start both the TCPWM channels simultaneously in the <a href="https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__common.html#gaafe86ec440bec9a2c23392f289cc3a8b"><i>Cy_TrigMux_SwTrigger()</i></a> function.

**Miscellaneous settings**  

- **STDIN/STDOUT setting**

  - Calling <a href="https://infineon.github.io/retarget-io/html/group__group__board__libs.html#ga21265301bf6e9239845227c2aead9293"><i>cy_retarget_io_init()</i></a> function to use UART as STDIN/STDOUT
    1. Initialize the ports (these pins are connected to KitProg3 COM port):
         - *CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_TX* - *UART TX* 
         - *CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_RX* - *UART RX* 
    2. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.
